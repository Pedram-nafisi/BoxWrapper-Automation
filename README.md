## 🚀 Features

- Two motors:
  - Up/Down motor (0.37 kW, 3-phase) controlled by VFD
  - Rotation motor (0.55 kW, 3-phase) controlled by VFD
- Limit switches for high/low endpoints
- Proximity sensors:
  - Stretch detection
  - Rotation count
  - Wrap-empty check
- Relay control (24VDC)
- HMI panel with real-time control and monitoring
- Power and protection design (cabling, MCB, power supply sizing)
